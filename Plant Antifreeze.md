Plant antifreeze is a chemical that reduces the freezing point of water in plant tissues. These chemicals can help plants withstand temperatures 2.2 to 9.4F lower than usual, depending on the type of plant. Antifreeze chemicals such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerin and other substances stimulate plants to produce antifreeze proteins and antifreeze amino acids to prevent themselves from being temporarily frozen or frosted.<br /><br />Some prominent business metrics are covered in this comprehensive Plant Antifreeze market report to help industry players in setting business objectives.
