A homogenizer is an equipment used for the homogenization of various types of material to produce suspensions, emulsions, and other products. Homogenization is the process of reducing particle sizes of products, such as fruit juices, jam, ice-cream, food additives, wine, and others under extreme pressure, turbulence, and shear stress for improving the stability and texture of the products. The liquid products are passed through a homogenizing valve at very high pressure.<br /><br />The research report comprises of drivers, trends and restrains, which has the power to transform the market either in positive or negative way.
