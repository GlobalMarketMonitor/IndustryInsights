Ethylene propylene rubber is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene (EPR) combined with a third comonomer adiene (EPDM). It is used as packing material. Ethylene propylene has excellent water resistance and it retains this property up to temperatures as high as approximately 120-140°C. On a contrary, ethylene propylene rubber has poor resistance to mineral oil and fuel. Ethylene propylene rubber is classified under two different type including ethylene propylene monomer (EPM) and EPDM.<br /><br />This Ethylene Propylene Rubber market report may be used to evaluate new goods before they are introduced to the market and to guide you through a new expansion by following a defined business strategy.
